# tkinter iphone simple calculator

This project is my first work using Python, created on my very first day of learning the language. It is a simple version of an iPhone calculator built with Tkinter, a popular GUI toolkit in Python. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as special functions such as AC (All Clear), +/- (Change Sign), % (Percentage), and Backspace.
